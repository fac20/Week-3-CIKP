# Week-3-CIKP

This week's theme was test-driven development. 

We have built [Cloudy With a Chance of Tasks](https://fac20.github.io/Week-3-CIKP/): a to-do list tracker that allows the user to create tasks and delete tasks.

## User stories

### On the landing page, select the plus icon to bring up the hidden task writing field

### Write your task and select 'Add' to create a cloud with your task on it and add it to the total amount displayed in the bottom right corner

### When the task is completed, select the checkbox to indicate that

Or if you no longer need to do the task, just bin it!

### Core
 - As an busy person, I want to: add tasks to a list so that I can keep track of them
 - Check things off my list so I can see what I've done
 - Delete things from the list if I don't need to do them anymore 
 - As a motor-impaired person, I want to: use all the features of the app without a mouse
 
### Stretch
 - As a busy person, I want to: filter out completed to-dos from my list so that I can focus on what's left to do
 
### Acceptance Criteria
- A working to-do list
- Tests for (at least) each user story
- A responsive, mobile-first design
- Ensure your app is accessible to as many different users as possible
